ExperienceCamera
================

ExperienceCamera is a sample app for the TinCanAPI/ExperienceAPI. I wrote this while on vacation in Orlando to be able to record my visual experiences using the TinCanAPI/ExperienceAPI. I wanted to share this sample code with anyone who wanted to do something similar and to promote the TinCanAPI/ExperienceAPI by creating another tool to create more statement data.


##Getting Started

### iOS App

1.) Install pod dependencies.

	pod install

2.) Set your LRS and credentials in SetStatementViewController.m file.

3.) Change xcam.herokuapp.com to your own viewer page url in FlipsideViewController.m file.


### NodeJs viewer app

Coming soon...




##Future Enhancments
* comments stored as statements with original statement as StatementRef
* user auth in NodeJs viewer app
